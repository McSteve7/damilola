<!-- Hi, my name is Damilola Ajiboye. I am a Product Manager that is passionate about leveraging technology to solve people's problems. So, you won't be surprised if I tell you that I enjoy listening to people talk to me about their problems, then understanding the problems and brainstorming how technology can be leveraged to solve them.

Prior to product management, I have worked in Digital Marketing, Web Design, Web Development, User Interface Design, and Sales where I've helped businesses of various sizes and across different industries to provide amazing experiences to their users and also drive growth. 

I am passionate about the startup and tech ecosystem and enjoy volunteering in building communities that are reducing the barrier to entry to tech. I currently volunteer with the [Black Product Managers Network](https://www.blackproductmanagers.com/) and [Web3 PMs](https://web3pms.substack.com/) where we help passionate individuals get into Product Management and help existing Product Managers level-up their PM journey by creating enabling infrastructures that supercharges their career journey. 

In the past, I've volunteered with [Visible Hands Venture Capital](https://www.visiblehands.vc/) as Product Evaluator for the [Visible Hand Fellowship](https://www.visiblehands.vc/fellowship) selection process.


🚀 Lately, I've developed much interest in the Developer Tooling and Experience space. I'm especially fascinated by how these amazing products help technical teams become more productive and help them focus on building user-centric products. 

I am also passionate about Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Web3, NFT, Play to earn (P2E) gaming and their potential to drive economic opportunities and financial inclusion for emerging markets.
