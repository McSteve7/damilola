Hi, my name is Damilola Ajiboye. I am a Product Manager that is passionate about leveraging technology to solve people's problems. So you won't be surprised if I tell you that I enjoy listening to people talk to me about their problems, understanding the problems and brainstorming how technology can be leveraged to solve the problems.

Prior to product management, I have some experience in Digital Marketing, Web Design and Development, User Interface Design, and Sales where I've helped businesses of various sizes and across different industries to provide amazing experiences to their users and also drive growth. 

I am passionate about the startup and tech ecosystem and enjoy volunteering in building communities that are reducing the barrier to entry to the tech space. I currently volunteer with the [Black Product Managers Network](https://www.blackproductmanagers.com/) and [Web3 PMs](https://web3pms.substack.com/) to help passionate individuals get into Product Management and help existing Product Managers level-up their PM journey by creating enabling infrastructures that enables this. 

In the past, I've volunteered with [Visible Hands Venture Capital](https://www.visiblehands.vc/) as Product Evaluator for the [Visible Hand Fellowship](https://www.visiblehands.vc/fellowship) selection process.


🚀 Lately, I've developed much interest in the Developer Tooling and Experience space. I'm especially fascinated by how these amazing products help technical teams become more productive and focus on building user-centric products. Other spaces that I am reading about are Decentralized Finance (DeFi), web3, NFT, Play to earn gaming and their potential to drive economic opportunities and financial inclusion for emerging markets.

<!-- Hi, my name is Damilola Ajiboye. I’m a Product Manager passionate about building user-centric products.

Before Product Management, I’ve been a web designer, a developer (front-end) and a digital marketer. The experiences gotten from these roles have been worthwhile in propelling me to be a better PM. 

😎 Off-work, I enjoy working on various projects (_the ones that require me to code, so that I don’t have to learn HTML from scratch again_), reading startup and fundraising news, listening to tech and startup podcast, and playing FIFA 🎮

🎯 I’m Interested in Finance and Investment, Artificial intelligence, and Community building.
