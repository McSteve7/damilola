 Hi, my name is **Damilola**. I’m a Product Manager passionate about building user-centric products.

Before Product Management, I’ve been a web designer, a developer (front-end) and a digital marketer. The experiences gotten from these roles have been worthwhile in propelling me to be a better PM. 

😎 Off-work, I enjoy working on various projects (_the ones that require me to code, so that I don’t have to learn HTML from scratch again_), reading startup and fundraising news, listening to tech and startup podcast, and playing FIFA   🎮.

🎯 I’m Interested in Finance and Investment, Artificial intelligence, and Community building.

🏠 Based in Lagos, Nigeria 🇳🇬,
