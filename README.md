✨ I'm a Product Manager passionate about building user-centric products that solve users pain points.

I enjoy coming up with strategies, talking to users, aligning team members to a product idea and building compelling products.

Asides PMing, I try to work on personal projects (mostly the ones that will require me to write some code), read startup and fundraising news and playing video games.
